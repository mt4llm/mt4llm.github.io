CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models.

In this article, we use metamorphic testing technology to evaluate natural language processing systems from the user&rsquo;s perspective to help users better understand the functionalities of these systems and then select the appropriate natural language processing system according to their specific needs. We have defined three metamorphic relation patterns. These metamorphic relation patterns respectively focus on some characteristics of different aspects of natural language processing. Moreover, on this basis, we defined seven metamorphic relations and chose three tasks (text similarity, text summarization, and text classification) to evaluate the quality of the system. Chinese is used as target language. We extended the defined abstract metamorphic relations to these tasks, and seven specific metamorphic relations were generated for each task. Then, we judged whether the metamorphic relations were satisfied for each task, and used them to evaluate the quality and robustness of the natural language processing system without reference output. We further applied the metamorphic test to three mainstream natural language processing systems (including BaiduCloud API, AliCloud API, and TencentCloud API), and on the PWAS-X datasets, LCSTS datasets, and THUCNews datasets. Experiments were carried out, revealing the advantages and disadvantages of each system. These results further show that the metamorphic test can effectively test the natural language processing system without annotated data.},\nDOI = {10.3390/math10081276}\n}"

With the development of QA technique, plenty of QA software has been applied in daily human life to provide convenient access of information retrieval. To investigate the performance of QA software, many benchmark datasets have been constructed to provide various test cases. However, current QA software is mainly tested in a reference-based paradigm, in which the expected outputs (labels) of test cases are mandatory to be annotated with much human effort before testing. As a result, neither the just-in-time test during usage nor the extensible test on massive unlabeled real-life data is feasible, which keeps the current testing of QA software from being flexible and sufficient. In this work, we propose a novel testing method, qaAskeR+, with five new Metamorphic Relations for QA software. qaAskeR+ does not refer to the annotated labels of test cases. Instead, based on the idea that a correct answer should imply a piece of reliable knowledge that always conforms with any other correct answer, qaAskeR+ tests QA software by inspecting its behaviors on multiple recursively asked questions that are relevant to the same or some further enriched knowledge. Experimental results show that qaAskeR+ can reveal quite a few violations that indicate actual answering issues on various mainstream QA software without using any pre-annotated labels.},\njournal = {Automated Software Engg.},\nmonth = {mar},\nnumpages = {44},\nkeywords = {Question answering, Testing and validation, Recursive metamorphic testing, Natural language processing}\n}"

To alleviate this challenge, in this paper, we design and implement a fuzzing framework for QA systems, namely QATest, based on the metamorphic testing theory. It provides the first uniform solution to generate tests with oracle information automatically for various QA systems, such as machine reading comprehension, open-domain QA, and QA on knowledge bases. To further improve testing efficiency and generate more tests detecting erroneous behaviors, we design N-Gram coverage and perplexity priority based on the features of the question data to guide the generation process. To evaluate the performance of QATest, we experiment with it on four QA systems that are designed for different tasks. The experiment results show that the tests generated by QATest detect hundreds of erroneous behaviors of QA systems efficiently. Also, the results confirm that the testing criteria can improve test diversity and fuzzing efficiency.},\nbooktitle = {ASE},\nkeywords = {automated testing, fuzz testing, natural language processing, question answering systems},\nlocation = {<conf-loc>, <city>Rochester</city>, <state>MI</state>, <country>USA</country>, </conf-loc>}\n}"

As a result, a relatively large proportion of the reported bugs are false positives. In this work, we proposed QAQA, a sentence-level mutation based metamorphic testing technique for QA software. To eliminate false positives and achieve precise automatic testing, QAQA leverages five Metamorphic Relations (MRs) as well as semantics-guided search and enhanced test oracles.

On the other hand, there is an increasing need to understand the characteristics of RE models in terms of various aspects. To mitigate these issues, this study proposes evaluating RE models by applying metamorphic testing (MT). A total of eight metamorphic relations (MRs) are identified based on three categories of transformation operations, namely replacement, swap, and combination. These MRs encode some expected properties of different aspects of RE. We further apply MT to three popular RE models.

However, they have been increasingly exploited to propagate toxic content, such as hate speech, malicious advertisement, and pornography, which can lead to highly negative impacts (e.g., harmful effects on teen mental health). Researchers and practitioners have been enthusiastically developing and extensively deploying textual content moderation software to address this problem. However, we find that malicious users can evade moderation by changing only a few words in the toxic content. Moreover, modern content moderation software's performance against malicious inputs remains underexplored. To this end, we propose MTTM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Textual content Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2, 000 text messages collected from real users and summarize eleven metamorphic relations across three perturbation levels: character, word, and sentence. MTTM employs these metamorphic relations on toxic textual contents to generate test cases, which are still toxic yet likely to evade moderation. In our evaluation, we employ MTTM to test three commercial textual content moderation software and two state-of-the-art moderation algorithms against three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTTM achieves up to 83.9\\%, 51\\%, and 82.5\\% error finding rates (EFR) when testing commercial moderation software provided by Google, Baidu, and Huawei, respectively, and it obtains up to 91.2\\% EFR when testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy. In addition, we leverage the test cases generated by MTTM to retrain the model we explored, which largely improves model robustness (0\\% ~ 5.9\\% EFR) while maintaining the accuracy on the original test set.

These systems are widely used in various natural language processing applications, such as information extraction, question answering, and sentiment analysis. However, the complexity and intractability of deep neural networks can make NER systems unreliable in certain circumstances, resulting in incorrect predictions. For example, NER systems may misidentify female names as chemicals or fail to recognize the names of minority groups, leading to user dissatisfaction. To tackle this problem, we introduce TIN, a novel, widely applicable approach for automatically testing and repairing various NER systems. The key idea for automated testing is that the NER predictions of the same named entities under similar contexts should be identical. The core idea for automated repairing is that similar named entities should have the same NER prediction under the same context. We use TIN to test two SOTA NER models and two commercial NER APIs, i.e., Azure NER and AWS NER. We manually verify 784 of the suspicious issues reported by TIN and find that 702 are erroneous issues, leading to high precision (85.0\\%-93.4\\%) across four categories of NER errors: omission, over-labeling, incorrect category, and range error. For automated repairing, TIN achieves a high error reduction rate (26.8\\%-50.6\\%) over the four systems under test, which successfully repairs 1,056 out of the 1,877 reported NER errors.},\nbooktitle = {FSE},\npages = {883\u2013894},\nnumpages = {12},\nkeywords = {software repairing, named entity recognition, Metamorphic testing, AI software},\n}"

Meanwhile, the complexity and intractability of RNN models that power the dialogue systems make their testing challenging. In this paper, we design and implement DialTest, the first RNN-driven dialogue system testing tool.

To improve the efficiency of detecting faults, DialTest further adopts Gini impurity to guide the test generation process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate DialTest. We first experiment it on two fundamental tasks, i.e., intent detection and slot filling, of natural language understanding. The experiment results show that DialTest can effectively detect hundreds of erroneous behaviors for different RNN-driven natural language understanding (NLU) modules of dialogue systems and improve their accuracy via retraining with the generated data.

Machine translation systems can return inferior results that lead to misunderstanding, medical misdiagnoses, threats to personal safety, or political conflicts. Despite its apparent importance, validating the robustness of machine translation systems is very difficult and has, therefore, been much under-explored.To tackle this challenge, we introduce structure-invariant testing (SIT), a novel metamorphic testing approach for validating machine translation software. Our key insight is that the translation results of \"similar\" source sentences should typically exhibit similar sentence structures. Specifically, SIT (1) generates similar source sentences by substituting one word in a given sentence with semantically similar, syntactically equivalent words; (2) represents sentence structure by syntax parse trees (obtained via constituency or dependency parsing); (3) reports sentence pairs whose structures differ quantitatively by more than some threshold. To evaluate SIT, we use it to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 source sentences as input, which led to 64 and 70 buggy issues with 69.5\\% and 70\\% top-1 accuracy, respectively.

To address this problem, we introduce a novel methodology called PatInv. The main intuition behind PatInv is that sentences with different meanings should not have the same translation. Under this general idea, we provide two realizations of PatInv that given an arbitrary sentence, generate syntactically similar but semantically different sentences by: (1) replacing one word in the sentence using a masked language model or (2) removing one word or phrase from the sentence based on its constituency structure. We then test whether the returned translations are the same for the original and modified sentences. We have applied PatInv to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator using 200 English sentences. Two language settings are considered: English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Chinese (En-Zh).

In mission-critical applications such as translating official documents, incorrect translation can have unpleasant or sometimes catastrophic consequences. This motivates recent research on the testing methodologies for machine translation systems. Existing methodologies mostly rely on metamorphic relations designed at the textual level (e.g., Levenshtein distance) or syntactic level (e.g., distance between grammar structures) to determine the correctness of translation results. However, these metamorphic relations do not consider whether the original and the translated sentences have the same meaning (i.e., semantic similarity). To address this problem, in this article we propose SemMT, an automatic testing approach for machine translation systems based on semantic similarity checking. SemMT applies round-trip translation and measures the semantic similarity between the original and the translated sentences. Our insight is that the semantics concerning logical relations and quantifiers in sentences can be captured by regular expressions (or deterministic finite automata) where efficient semantic equivalence/similarity checking algorithms can be applied. Leveraging the insight, we propose three semantic similarity metrics and implement them in SemMT. We compared SemMT with related state-of-the-art testing techniques, demonstrating the effectiveness of mistranslation detection. The experiment results show that SemMT outperforms existing metrics, achieving an increase of 34.2\\% and 15.4\\% on accuracy and F-score, respectively. We also study the possibility of further enhancing the performance by combining various metrics. Finally, we discuss a solution to locate the suspicious trip in round-trip translation, which provides hints for bug diagnosis.},\njournal = {ACM Trans. Softw. Eng.

However, machine translation systems are far from perfect. To tackle this problem, researchers have proposed several approaches to testing machine translation. A promising trend among these approaches is to use word replacement, where only one word in the original sentence is replaced with another word to form a sentence pair. However, precise control of the impact of word replacement remains an outstanding issue in these approaches.To address this issue, we propose CAT, a novel word-replacement-based approach, whose basic idea is to identify word replacement with controlled impact (referred to as isotopic replacement). To achieve this purpose, we use a neural-based language model to encode the sentence context, and design a neural-network-based algorithm to evaluate context-aware semantic similarity between two words. Furthermore, similar to TransRepair, a state-of-the-art word-replacement-based approach, CAT also provides automatic fixing of revealed bugs without model retraining.Our evaluation on Google Translate and Transformer indicates that CAT achieves significant improvements over TransRepair. In particular, 1) CAT detects seven more types of bugs than TransRepair; 2) CAT detects 129\\% more translation bugs than TransRepair; 3) CAT repairs twice more bugs than TransRepair, many of which may bring serious consequences if left unfixed; and 4) CAT has better efficiency than TransRepair in input generation (0.01s v.s. 0.41s) and comparable efficiency with TransRepair in bug repair (1.92s v.s. 1.34s).},\nbooktitle = {Proc. of the 44th Int.

Unfortunately, erroneous translations may result in severe consequences, such as financial losses. This requires to improve the accuracy and the reliability of machine translation systems. However, it is challenging to test machine translation systems because of the complexity and intractability of the underlying neural models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel metamorphic testing approach by syntactic tree pruning (STP) to validate machine translation systems. Our key insight is that a pruned sentence should have similar crucial semantics compared with the original sentence. Specifically, STP (1) proposes a core semantics-preserving pruning strategy by basic sentence structures and dependency relations on the level of syntactic tree representation; (2) generates source sentence pairs based on the metamorphic relation; (3) reports suspicious issues whose translations break the consistency property by a bag-of-words model. We further evaluate STP on two state-of-the-art machine translation systems (i.e., Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator) with 1,200 source sentences as inputs. The results show that STP accurately finds 5,073 unique erroneous translations in Google Translate and 5,100 unique erroneous translations in Bing Microsoft Translator (400\\% more than state-of-the-art techniques), with 64.5\\% and 65.4\\% precision, respectively. The reported erroneous translations vary in types and more than 90\\% of them found by state-of-the-art techniques. There are 9,393 erroneous translations unique to STP, which is 711.9\\% more than state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, STP is quite effective in detecting translation errors for the original sentences with a recall reaching 74.0\\%, improving state-of-the-art techniques by 55.1\\% on average.},\njournal = {ACM Trans.

Its main advantage is that it does not rely on a ground truth to generate test cases. However, existing studies are mostly concerned with robustness-like metamorphic relations, limiting the scope of linguistic properties they can test. We propose three new classes of metamorphic relations, which address the properties of systematicity, compositionality and transitivity. Unlike robustness, our relations are defined over multiple source inputs, thus increasing the number of test cases that we can produce by a polynomial factor. With them, we test the internal consistency of state-of-the-art NLP models, and show that they do not always behave according to their expected linguistic properties. Lastly, we introduce a novel graphical notation that efficiently summarises the inner structure of metamorphic relations.\",\n}"

People routinely use machine translation software in their daily lives for tasks such as ordering food in a foreign restaurant, receiving medical diagnosis and treatment from foreign doctors, and reading international political news online. However, due to the complexity and intractability of the underlying neural networks, modern machine translation software is still far from robust and can produce poor or incorrect translations; this can lead to misunderstanding, financial loss, threats to personal safety and health, and political conflicts. To address this problem, we introduce referentially transparent inputs (RTIs), a simple, widely applicable methodology for validating machine translation software. A referentially transparent input is a piece of text that should have similar translations when used in different contexts. Our practical implementation, Purity, detects when this property is broken by a translation. To evaluate RTI, we use Purity to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 unlabeled sentences, which detected 123 and 142 erroneous translations with high precision (79.3\\% and 78.3\\%). The translation errors are diverse, including examples of under-translation, over-translation, word/phrase mistranslation, incorrect modification, and unclear logic.},\nbooktitle = {ICSE},\npages = {410\u2013422},\nnumpages = {13},\nkeywords = {Machine translation, Metamorphic testing, Referential transparency, Testing},\nlocation = {Madrid, Spain},\n}"

In this context, the software quality becomes highly correlated to the quality of code generators used during software development. Eventual failures may result in a loss of confidence for the developers, who will unlikely continue to use these generators. It is then crucial to verify the correct behaviour of code generators in order to preserve software quality and reliability. In this paper, we leverage the metamorphic testing approach to automatically detect inconsistencies in code generators via so-called \u201cmetamorphic relations\u201d. We define the metamorphic relation (i.e., test oracle) as a comparison between the variations of performance and resource usage of test suites running on different versions of generated code. We rely on statistical methods to find the threshold value from which an unexpected variation is detected. We evaluate our approach by testing a family of code generators with respect to resource usage and performance metrics for five different target software platforms. The experimental results show that our approach is able to detect, among 95 executed test suites, 11 performance and 15 memory usage inconsistencies.},\nyear = {2020}\n}"

Metamorphic testing enables the generation of test cases in the absence of an oracle by exploiting the so\u2013called metamorphic relations between the inputs and outputs of multiple executions of the program under test. In the last two decades, metamorphic testing has been successfully used to detect functional faults in different domains. However, its applicability to performance testing remains unexplored.\nObjective\nWe propose the application of metamorphic testing to reveal performance failures.\nMethod\nWe define Performance Metamorphic Relations (PMRs) as expected relations between performance measurements of multiple executions of the program under test. These relations can be turned into assertions for the automated detection of performance bugs, removing the need for complex benchmarks and domain experts guidance. As a further benefit, PMRs can be turned into fitness functions to guide search\u2013based techniques on the generation of test data.\nResults\nThe feasibility of the approach is illustrated through an experimental proof of concept in the context of the automated analysis of feature models.\nConclusion\nThe results confirm the potential of metamorphic testing, in combination with search-based techniques, to automate the detection of performance bugs.\"\n}"

Checking whether the output of a model transformation\n\tis correct is a manual and error-prone task, referred to as the oracle\n\tproblem. Metamorphic testing alleviates the oracle problem by exploiting\n\tthe relations among different inputs and outputs of the program under\n\ttest, so-called metamorphic relations (MRs). One of the main challenges\n\tin metamorphic testing is the automated inference of likely MRs.\n\tThis paper proposes an approach to automatically infer likely MRs\n\tfor ATL model transformations, where the tester does not need to\n\thave any knowledge of the transformation. The inferred MRs aim at\n\tdetecting faults in model transformations in three application scenarios,\n\tnamely regression testing, incremental transformations and migrations\n\tamong transformation languages. In the experiments performed, the\n\tinferred likely MRs have proved to be quite accurate, with a precision\n\tof 96.4% from a total of 4101 true positives out of 4254 MRs inferred.\n\tFurthermore, they have been useful for identifying mutants in regression\n\ttesting scenarios, with a mutation score of 93.3%. Finally, our approach\n\tcan be used in conjunction with current approaches for the automatic\n\tgeneration of test cases.},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2017.05.043},\n  issn = {0164-1212},\n  keywords = {Model-Driven engineering, Metamorphic testing, Metamorphic relations,\n\tModel transformations, Automatic inference, Generic approach},\n  owner = {Sergio},\n  timestamp = {2019.01.08}\n}"

Metamorphic testing alleviates the oracle problem by reasoning on the relations that are expected to hold among multiple executions of the system under test, which are known as Metamorphic Relations (MRs). However, the development of effective MRs is often challenging and requires the involvement of domain experts. In this paper, we present a case study aiming at automating this process. To this end, we implemented GAssertMRs, a tool to automatically generate MRs with genetic programming. We assess the cost-effectiveness of this tool in the context of an industrial case study from the elevation domain. Our experimental results show that in most cases GAssertMRs outperforms the other baselines, including manually generated MRs developed with the help of domain experts. We then describe the lessons learned from our experiments and we outline the future work for the adoption of this technique by industrial practitioners.},\n    booktitle = {Proc. of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conf. and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering},\n    pages = {1264\u20131274},\n    numpages = {11},\n    keywords = {cyber physical systems, oracle generation, genetic programming, mutation testing, evolutionary algorithm, oracle improvement, quality of service, metamorphic testing},\n    location = {Athens, Greece},\n    series = {ESEC/FSE 2021}\n}"

In theory, these techniques mutate an existing test case (e.g., a sentence with its label) and assume the generated one preserves an equivalent or similar semantic meaning and thus, the same label. However, in practice, many of the generated test cases fail to preserve similar semantic meaning and are unnatural (e.g., grammar errors), which leads to a high false alarm rate and unnatural test cases. Our evaluation study finds that 44\\% of the test cases generated by the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches are false alarms. These test cases require extensive manual checking effort, and instead of improving NLP software, they can even degrade NLP software when utilized in model training. To address this problem, we propose AEON for Automatic Evaluation Of NLP test cases. For each generated test case, it outputs scores based on semantic similarity and language naturalness. We employ AEON to evaluate test cases generated by four popular testing techniques on five datasets across three typical NLP tasks. The results show that AEON aligns the best with human judgment. In particular, AEON achieves the best average precision in detecting semantic inconsistent test cases, outperforming the best baseline metric by 10\\%. In addition, AEON also has the highest average precision of finding unnatural test cases, surpassing the baselines by more than 15\\%. Moreover, model training with test cases prioritized by AEON leads to models that are more accurate and robust, demonstrating AEON\u2019s potential in improving NLP software.},\nbooktitle = {ISSTA},\npages = {202\u2013214},\nnumpages = {13},\nkeywords = {test case quality, NLP software testing},\n}"

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\\%} (4.6{\\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\",\n}"

However, LLMs are known to distort facts and make non-factual statements (i.e., hallucinations) when dealing with QA tasks, which may affect the deployment of LLMs in real-life situations. In this work, we propose DrHall, a framework for detecting and reducing the factual hallucinations of black-box LLMs with metamorphic testing (MT). We believe that hallucinated answers are unstable. Therefore, when LLMs hallucinate, they are more likely to produce different answers if we use metamorphic testing to make LLMs re-execute the same task with different execution paths, which motivates the design of DrHall. The effectiveness of DrHall is evaluated empirically on three datasets, including a self-built dataset of natural language questions: FactHalluQA, as well as two datasets of programming questions: Refactory and LeetCode. The evaluation results confirm that DrHall can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art baselines, obtaining an average F1 score of over 0.856 for hallucination detection. For hallucination correction, DrHall can also outperform the state-of-the-art baselines, with an average hallucination correction rate of over 53\\%. We hope that our work can enhance the reliability of LLMs and provide new insights for the research of LLM hallucination mitigation.},\njournal = {Proc. ACM Softw.

A major issue is fact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where LLMs produce content contradicting ground truth facts. Addressing FCH is difficult due to two key challenges: 1) Automatically constructing and updating benchmark datasets is hard, as existing methods rely on manually curated static benchmarks that cannot cover the broad, evolving spectrum of FCH cases. 2) Validating the reasoning behind LLM outputs is inherently difficult, especially for complex logical relations.    To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel logic-programming-aided metamorphic testing technique for FCH detection. We develop an extensive and extensible framework that constructs a comprehensive factual knowledge base by crawling sources like Wikipedia, seamlessly integrated into Drowzee. Using logical reasoning rules, we transform and augment this knowledge into a large set of test cases with ground truth answers. We test LLMs on these cases through template-based prompts, requiring them to provide reasoned answers. To validate their reasoning, we propose two semantic-aware oracles that assess the similarity between the semantic structures of the LLM answers and ground truth.    Our approach automatically generates useful test cases and identifies hallucinations across six LLMs within nine domains, with hallucination rates ranging from 24.7\\% to 59.8\\%. Key findings include LLMs struggling with temporal concepts, out-of-distribution knowledge, and lack of logical reasoning capabilities. The results show that logic-based test cases generated by Drowzee effectively trigger and detect hallucinations.    To further mitigate the identified FCHs, we explored model editing techniques, which proved effective on a small scale (with edits to fewer than 1000 knowledge pieces). Our findings emphasize the need for continued community efforts to detect and mitigate model hallucinations.},\njournal = {Proc. ACM Program.

Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks.

These hallucinations present challenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external resources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete coverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor scalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which are often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper presents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that leverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods, MetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs.    MetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if an LLM\u2019s response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will be violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource hallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on two open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the four LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin ranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and 0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score). For instance, with Mistral-7B, MetaQA achieves an average F1-score of 0.435, compared to SelfCheckGPT\u2019s F1-score of 0.205, representing an improvement rate of 112.2\\%. MetaQA also demonstrates superiority across all different categories of questions.},\njournal = {Proc. ACM Softw.
